Countries like Ethiopia, Bangladesh, Guatemela have suffered from severe spread of COVID-19. Relied heavily on curfews and travel restrictions and less on strengthening the public health system and monitoring, suffering the consequences.
Nigeria and Ghana did well in controlling the surge towards the end of 2020 once they started implementing health measures.
Kenya and Afghanistan showed decent fight against COVID. Once more, public health strengthening and economic measures helped their cause.
Nepal and South Africa brought down their COVID cases massively with similar measures and interestingly, the heavy use of media and social media. Same goes for Uganda, who did well considering they've more than twice the population of Guatemala.
Tanzania declared themselves COVID free from June 2020 and have now also rejected the vaccine. With a population of 58 million, that is impressive, and once more they've made heavy use of media to support their cause.
So, we could observe from this data, how using the right measures with awareness spread through multiple mediums can better aid the COVID-19 control in these countries.
